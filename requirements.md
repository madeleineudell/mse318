## Attendance

Students are required to attend class, with at most one absence.

Any student may also attend up to one class remotely via [Zoom](https://stanford.zoom.us/j/6394072382?pwd=bndKcXBpRFdOb2x5VFhuT0kzN1QvQT09), or more by prior arrangement with the instructor.

## Grading

Course grades have three components:

### Quiz (10%)

Most classes will begin with a short quiz to reinforce the main ideas of the reading. Your lowest quiz score will be dropped.

### Present a Paper (30%)

Students will each lead a discussion on a paper twice (or so), likely in teams depending on course enrollment.

The student leading the discussion will prepare:
- A 30 minute presentation using slides
- Two quiz questions on the paper
- A class activity or questions for discussion

See the [Presentations](presentations) page for detailed guidelines.

### Research Project (60%)

The final research project should explore a new idea for safe and constrained AI.

**Team Size:** Projects can be in teams of up to three students except by special advance permission from the instructor.

**Deliverables:**
- Initial project proposal
- Midterm report
- Final report
- In-class presentation (optional/as scheduled)

**Important:** Research projects can (and should!) advance your PhD research.
